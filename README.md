# RegistrationApp

An application for User Authentication. By entering a name, an email address, and a password, the user can register (SignUp). 
After successful registration, the user can sign in (using email and password). 
It uses Google Firebase for the user-authentication and the Firestore database for maintaining each user's data separately and securely.
On successful sign-in, the main screen will appear. Users can then Signout from there.
It is possible to use this app to provide a user authentication service to build some high-level applications from the main screen.
